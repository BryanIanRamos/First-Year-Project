<i>(Jeremy Zucker)</i>
<p class="pp"> I don't wanna smoke, I don't need a drink<br>
Just tell me how you feel, tell me what you think<br>
'Cause I've been on my own for a fuckin' while<br>
And I don't need a girl, I just wanna smile<br>
Gettin' my mind right<br>
I wait 'til the time's right<br>
I'm meanin' to tell you<br>
Why it's hard to sleep at night<br>
There's nothin' to fear now<br>
Girl, we should be here now<br>
So why don't you hear me out, I'm sayin'<br>
Talk is overrated, let's just vibe<br>
And love is overrated in my mind<br>
Girl, talk is overrated, let's just vibe<br>
Just for tonight<br>
I'll be yours if you want me to<br>
I'll be yours if you want me to<br>
I've been hella stressed, I would rather chill<br>
I know you looked at me, wonder how I deal<br>
But look inside my soul, I don't mean to front<br>
'Cause really I don't know what the fuck I want<br>
I remember when we were more than friends<br>
I would just pretend, that was cold<br>
After all this shit, I could not let you in<br>
Summer went, saved up all the money that I would have spent<br>
On you, oh<br>
Talk is overrated, let's just vibe<br>
And love is overrated in my mind<br>
Girl, talk is overrated, let's just vibe<br>
Just for tonight<br>
I'll be yours if you want me to<br>
I'll be yours if you want me to<br>
Yeah, let's talk it out<br>
Girl, time out<br>
I know that you only with me for the clout, sit down<br>
You had too much to drink<br>
Maybe it's my fault<br>
I remember you would pull up, pour up Hennessy askin' to smoke<br>
No, no, there you go again<br>
Mix and blow it down<br>
There's brand-new hoes around, yeah<br>
And when the night is done, you be hittin' my line<br>
Tell me your phone at one percent<br>
3:00 a.m., you wanna vibe<br>
Talk is overrated, let's just vibe<br>
And love is overrated in my mind<br>
Girl, talk is overrated, let's just vibe<br>
Just for tonight<br>
I'll be yours if you want me to<br>
I'll be yours if you want me to
